# Simple to-do list

This simple to-do app as for goal to learning the basic of flutter development

## Description

This application is used to keep a list of task to-do. 
The task can be added, edit, cross as completed, deleted and move in the list. An optional local notification can be set at a time and date of choice.
The first use of the application was to learn the basic of development in Flutter.  The primary reason I choose Flutter is to be able to deploy the application on multiple platform with only one codebase.

At first, the application will only be available for Android, but I'm looking to develop a web version. For this, A backend will be need because for now, the data are only saved locally with Flutter Hive. Once the first version of the application will be completed, I plan to use Firebase to make it usable between the different platform.


## Installation

Once the first version of the application will be completed. It will be available to install through the Google Play Store.
